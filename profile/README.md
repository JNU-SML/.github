WELCOME TO OUR LAB github
====
Our group is interested in developing and applying mesoscale simulation models and computational tools to investigate structural, thermodynamic, and dynamic phenomena in various soft matter systems, including but not limited to polymer melts, liquid crystalline polymers, networked polymers, amphiphilic polymers, polymer brushes etc. In addition, efforts are underway to combine artificial intelligence and data-based technologies, which have recently grown in interest, to develop novel polymer materials and systems.
